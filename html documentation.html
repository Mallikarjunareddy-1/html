<h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It provides the basic structure of websites, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript.</p>
HTML documents are essentially plain text files saved with a .html extension and can be created and edited using any text editor. These documents are then interpreted by web browsers to display the content in a structured and visually appealing manner. HTML5, the latest version of HTML, introduced new elements and attributes that provide better support for multimedia, improved form controls, and enhanced accessibility features.</body>
